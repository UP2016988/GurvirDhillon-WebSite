Personal profile:
Technological ability
Passionate about technology, currently working towards a software engineering degree. Looking to create and maintain systems that help everyday users with the completion of tasks. Keen to learn from experienced professionals in a workplace environment. 
Used online courses and formal education to gain skills in modern programming paradigms and languages including Python, JavaScript, Node.JS, React.JS, Object-oriented programming and command line scripting. I have also used low level languages such as C, allowing me to compile and execute the code instructed to the operating system.
I have gained qualifications in GCSE Information Technology and BTEC Level 3 Information Technology. In addition, I have experience in using standard software packages such as PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, Word and many other Microsoft packages which I had used on my placement at MYM solicitors which we had to handle cases and summarise the notes to give to the barrister when dealing with the case. 
Communication and teamworking
A strong candidate that can form and maintain relations with colleagues, clients and customers.
In my role as an Administrative Assistant for D & B Crash Repairs, I worked directly alongside with a wide variety of clients and colleagues and we often communicated daily regarding requests and how to overcome issues. I built strong relations within my workforce and was often referred to as an approachable individual and a team player. I am adaptable and can undertake the role of a leader if required of me. I have showcased my skills in many situations such as for my first-year project for simulating a network with my peers at university.
Problem solving and organisational skills
I manage my workload and prioritise it in a timely manner whilst ensuring I complete it to a high standard for example, the demands made of me during my university program. I can adapt and I am resourceful using an organised method to prepare my workload for completion. I have had to work in geographically diverse teams all of whom were remote working to deliver a key University networking project. 
Willingness to learn
I am always keen to take on new challenges and broaden my skill set. For example, beyond my academic studies, I have taken numerous online courses to expand my knowledge including cybersecurity, network security and object-oriented programming. Additionally, I have bought books to complement my studies and my interests, for instance “Clean Code” by Robert C Martin, “You don’t know JavaScript Yet” by Kyle Simpson and “Eloquent JavaScript” by Marijn Haverbeke. 
Resilience
I am always dedicated to the task at hand and follow it through until completion no matter how great a challenge it may be. I love challenging tasks as it enables me to grow as an individual and expand both my soft and hard skills. During my time in sixth form, I faced challenges with other team members motivation during group coursework. I spent time with these individuals to understand the issues they were having with the coursework and how I could help them solve some of those challenges.

Hobbies/interests:
I enjoy keeping fit activities such as running, cycling and sessions at the gym. Pre-covid I used to regularly play chess at a Chess Club. I have competed in numerous chess competitions and won a tournament where I was up against 20 other participants.

I regularly listen to podcasts about the stock market, science related content and mindfulness. I like to travel around the world and experience different cultures and have been fortunate to visit places such as Thailand, India, Hawaii, Dubai and San Francisco. 

I am currently developing a side project alongside my academic studies, which is a mental health website which monitors the user’s mood, allows the user to feel in a safe space and give them access to resources that they require.
